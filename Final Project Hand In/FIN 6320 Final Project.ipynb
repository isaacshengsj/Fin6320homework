    "The prices between all the monte carlo methods were very similar and also very close to the Black-Scholes price.  The standard errors between the Naive, Antithetic, and Stratified Monte Carlo methods were very similar in our results with the exception of the Control Variate standard error (for the call), which was much lower than the standard errors of the other three methods.  If we could the the Control Variate put code to work, we should observe a decreased standard error, also.  In theory, the standard errors of the antithetic, stratified, and control variate methods should be lower than that of the naive method because each method is more accurately calculating the call price (by using more draws of random variables, creating a more normal distribution, or correcting the price using another price estimation).  This result was not fully observed in our data, but is what should be the case."

    "We started trying to add code to probo to price the Asian option, but we didn't figure it all out before we ran out of time.  See the engine.py file in the github folder for our attempt.  You will find the main pricer under the title 'AsianPricer' and the Control Variate function under the title 'GeometricAsian'.  We didn't finish either of the function codes, but feel free to look at our progress.  Since we didn't finish the code, we didn't create a test script to run this file and have not run it.  Therefore, we don't have the option price and standard error answers and cannot compare it to the Naive Monte Carlo method.  Just as in the graphs for problem 1, the control variate method would have had a much tighter spot price distribution in the histogram and would would have converged to the Black-Scholes price with less simulations than the Naive method.
